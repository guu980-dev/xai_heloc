    "\n",
    "- **NumSatisfactoryTrades (0.3202)**: This feature had the highest positive influence, meaning that the customer has a good number of satisfactory trades, which greatly helped classify them as \"Good.\"\n",

    "- **MaxDelq2PublicRecLast12M (0.2128)**: This reflects the maximum delinquency in public records over the past 12 months. A moderate influence, it helped classify the customer as \"Good\" due to no severe delinquencies.\n",
    "- **Other Features**: The remaining features had smaller positive influences, indicating that while they contributed, their impact on the final prediction was less significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LIME Analysis:\n",
    "LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) works by analyzing feature thresholds that contributed to the prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MSinceMostRecentInqexcl7days <= -7.00 (-0.1869)**: A large negative influence, suggesting that the lack of recent inquiries negatively impacted the prediction.\n",
    "- **6.00 < MaxDelq2PublicRecLast12M <= 7.00 (-0.1356)**: A moderately negative influence, indicating that the customer had some public records but not severe delinquencies.\n",
    "- **96.00 < PercentTradesNeverDelq <= 100.00 (-0.1241)**: This feature had a negative contribution, as the percentage of non-delinquent trades was lower than expected for a \"Good\" classification.\n",
    "- **NumSatisfactoryTrades > 27.00 (-0.1108)**: Surprisingly, a high number of satisfactory trades had a negative influence, perhaps because too many trades could indicate excessive credit use.\n",
    "- **NumTradesOpeninLast12M > 3.00 (0.0588)**: This feature positively influenced the prediction, as the customer opened multiple trades in the past year, which might signal active credit use without delinquencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison:\n",
    "Both SHAP and LIME highlight similar features but interpret their importance differently. SHAP assigns a more straightforward contribution value to each feature, indicating how much each feature pushes the prediction toward \"Good.\" LIME, on the other hand, focuses on thresholds and how crossing certain values positively or negatively influences the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Similarities**: Both methods agree on the importance of features like **NumSatisfactoryTrades**, **MaxDelq2PublicRecLast12M**, and **PercentTradesNeverDelq**. However, SHAP sees these as having generally positive contributions, while LIME shows nuanced positive or negative impacts based on specific thresholds.\n",
    "- **Differences**: LIME focuses more on specific ranges or conditions, which can lead to features being treated negatively or positively based on those thresholds, whereas SHAP looks at the overall contribution of each feature without specific cutoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Technical Summary:\n",
    "The model predicted that the customer is \"Good\" in terms of credit risk. This decision was mainly influenced by positive factors like having a good number of satisfactory credit trades and a high percentage of non-delinquent credit history. Additionally, the customer had no major recent inquiries, which suggests stability. However, some aspects like having too many credit trades or slightly lower percentages of never-delinquent trades slightly detracted from the \"Good\" classification. Overall, the positive factors outweighed the negatives, leading the model to predict \"Good\" with about 57% confidence."

    "## Understanding the Credit Risk Prediction: A SHAP and LIME Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We've been tasked with understanding a credit risk prediction made by an XGBClassifier. The model has predicted that this customer is a \"Good\" credit risk. To gain deeper insights into the model's decision-making process, we'll employ two explainability techniques: SHAP and LIME.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SHAP Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) provides a game-theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It assigns each feature a value that represents its contribution to the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features and Their Contributions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NumSatisfactoryTrades:** This feature had the most significant positive impact, suggesting that the customer's history of satisfactory trades played a crucial role in the positive prediction.\n",
    "* **PercentTradesNeverDelq:** A high percentage of trades without delinquencies also contributed positively to the prediction.\n",
    "* **MSinceMostRecentInqexcl7days:** The time since the customer's most recent inquiry (excluding those within 7 days) had a positive impact, indicating that recent inquiries might not have been a major concern.\n",
    "* **NumTradesOpeninLast12M:** Having a moderate number of open trades in the last 12 months was positively correlated with the prediction.\n",
    "* **MaxDelq2PublicRecLast12M:** The maximum delinquency on public records in the last 12 months had a negative impact, but it wasn't as severe as other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LIME Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "LIME (Local Interpretable Model Explanations) approximates the complex model locally around a specific prediction. It constructs a simpler, interpretable model to explain the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features and Their Thresholds:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **MSinceMostRecentInqexcl7days:** A recent inquiry (less than 7 days) would have likely had a negative impact.\n",
    "* **MaxDelq2PublicRecLast12M:** A higher delinquency score (6-7) would have also been negative.\n",
    "* **PercentTradesNeverDelq:** A lower percentage of trades without delinquencies would have been detrimental.\n",
    "* **NumSatisfactoryTrades:** Having fewer satisfactory trades would have negatively influenced the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison and Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Both SHAP and LIME highlight the importance of the customer's credit history and recent behavior. However, LIME provides more granular information about the specific thresholds that influenced the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Synthesized Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's positive prediction was primarily driven by the customer's strong credit history, as evidenced by the high number of satisfactory trades and low delinquency rates. The time since the most recent inquiry also played a role, suggesting that recent inquiries weren't a major concern. While the customer had some negative factors, such as a moderate number of open trades and a minor delinquency, these were outweighed by the positive aspects of their credit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Explanation for Non-Experts\n",
    "\n",
    "The model predicted that this customer is a \"Good\" credit risk based on their strong credit history. They have a history of making payments on time and have few delinquencies. While they have opened a few new accounts recently, this didn't significantly impact the prediction. Overall, their positive credit history and responsible financial behavior led the model to conclude that they are a low-risk customer.\n"

    "4. **Final Explanation for Non-Experts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The model predicted that you're likely to be a \"Good\" credit risk, meaning you're expected to keep up with your payments. This prediction is based on several factors in your credit history:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have a strong track record of satisfactory trades (financial transactions).\n",
    "2. A high percentage of your trades have never been late.\n",
    "3. It's been a while since your last credit inquiry, which is viewed positively.\n",
    "4. You've opened a reasonable number of new accounts in the past year.\n",
    "5. You haven't had any serious payment delays in the recent past.\n",
    "\n",
    "These positive factors outweighed some potentially concerning aspects, like the number of recently opened trades. The model is about 57% confident in its \"Good\" prediction, which means while it leans towards you being a good credit risk, there's still some uncertainty. Always remember to maintain good financial habits to keep your credit status healthy."

    "- **MaxDelq2PublicRecLast12M (0.2128)**: Despite being a negative indicator (maximum delinquency), this feature did not severely impact the decision, contributing positively to the prediction.\n",
    "- **Other Features**: Factors like **NumBank2NatlTradesWHighUtilization**, **NumTotalTrades**, and **NumRevolvingTradesWBalance** had smaller positive contributions, signaling moderate but less influential roles in the decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **LIME Analysis**:\n",
    "LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) interprets predictions by looking at feature thresholds and their contributions. Here's how the features influenced the decision:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MSinceMostRecentInqexcl7days <= -7.00 (-0.1869)**: This feature negatively influenced the prediction, as the customer had no recent inquiries, which in this case might signal risk aversion or a lack of credit activity.\n",
    "- **6.00 < MaxDelq2PublicRecLast12M <= 7.00 (-0.1356)**: This threshold for public records indicates that there was a delinquency, negatively impacting the prediction.\n",
    "- **96.00 < PercentTradesNeverDelq <= 100.00 (-0.1241)**: While the customer had a high percentage of non-delinquent trades, it was slightly lower than ideal, causing a minor negative effect on the \"Good\" prediction.\n",
    "- **NumSatisfactoryTrades > 27.00 (-0.1108)**: Contrary to SHAP's interpretation, LIME suggests that having more than 27 satisfactory trades slightly decreased the likelihood of being classified as \"Good,\" potentially indicating overextension of credit.\n",
    "- **NumTradesOpeninLast12M > 3.00 (0.0588)**: This feature had a small positive effect, as it shows the customer is actively using credit, which can be seen as a good sign.\n",
    "- **Other Features**: The remaining features such as **NumRevolvingTradesWBalance** and **PercentInstallTrades** had relatively minor influences, either positively or negatively impacting the prediction based on their thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Comparison of SHAP and LIME**:\n",
    "Both SHAP and LIME provide valuable insights into the prediction, but they approach the problem differently:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Similarities**: Both methods highlight the importance of features like **NumSatisfactoryTrades**, **MaxDelq2PublicRecLast12M**, and **PercentTradesNeverDelq**. These features play a central role in shaping the model’s prediction.\n",
    "- **Differences**: SHAP tends to interpret features like **NumSatisfactoryTrades** and **PercentTradesNeverDelq** positively, while LIME assigns negative impacts based on specific thresholds. SHAP looks at the overall contribution of each feature, whereas LIME is more focused on particular ranges or thresholds of the feature values. For example, LIME finds that having more than 27 satisfactory trades reduces the chance of being classified as \"Good,\" while SHAP suggests the opposite.\n",
    "- **Unique Insights**: SHAP is more straightforward, showing how much each feature pushes the prediction towards \"Good.\" LIME offers a nuanced view, focusing on feature ranges and thresholds, which can help uncover specific conditions where a feature might have a negative impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Non-Technical Summary**:\n",
    "The model predicted that this customer would be a \"Good\" credit risk, meaning they are unlikely to have any serious payment problems in the future. Here’s a simple explanation of why:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The customer has a good number of successful credit transactions, which signals they manage credit well.\n",
    "- They have a high percentage of credit accounts that have never been late, reinforcing that they handle credit responsibly.\n",
    "- The customer hasn’t applied for new credit recently, which suggests they aren’t in immediate need of more credit, a good sign for stability.\n",
    "- While the customer had some public records of delinquency, it wasn’t severe enough to impact the final decision heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both SHAP and LIME agree on the importance of the customer’s credit history and recent activity. Although some features show minor negatives, the positives outweigh them, leading to the final prediction of \"Good.\""

    "## Understanding the Credit Risk Prediction: A SHAP and LIME Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We've been tasked with understanding a credit risk prediction made by an XGBClassifier. The model has predicted that this customer is a \"Good\" credit risk. To gain deeper insights into the model's decision-making process, we'll employ two explainability techniques: SHAP and LIME.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SHAP Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) provides a game-theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It assigns each feature a value that represents its contribution to the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features and Their Contributions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NumSatisfactoryTrades:** This feature had the most significant positive impact, suggesting that the customer's history of satisfactory trades played a crucial role in the positive prediction.\n",
    "* **PercentTradesNeverDelq:** A high percentage of trades without delinquencies also contributed positively to the prediction.\n",
    "* **MSinceMostRecentInqexcl7days:** The time since the customer's most recent inquiry (excluding those within 7 days) had a positive impact, indicating that recent inquiries might not have been a major concern.\n",
    "* **NumTradesOpeninLast12M:** Having a moderate number of open trades in the last 12 months was positively correlated with the prediction.\n",
    "* **MaxDelq2PublicRecLast12M:** The maximum delinquency on public records in the last 12 months had a negative impact, but it wasn't as severe as other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LIME Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "LIME (Local Interpretable Model Explanations) approximates the complex model locally around a specific prediction. It constructs a simpler, interpretable model to explain the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features and Their Thresholds:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **MSinceMostRecentInqexcl7days:** A recent inquiry (less than 7 days) would have likely had a negative impact.\n",
    "* **MaxDelq2PublicRecLast12M:** A higher delinquency score (6-7) would have also been negative.\n",
    "* **PercentTradesNeverDelq:** A lower percentage of trades without delinquencies would have been detrimental.\n",
    "* **NumSatisfactoryTrades:** Having fewer satisfactory trades would have negatively influenced the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison of SHAP and LIME\n",
    "\n",
    "Both SHAP and LIME highlight the importance of the customer's credit history and recent behavior. However, LIME provides more granular information about the specific thresholds that influenced the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Similarities:** Both methods agree on the significance of the customer's credit history and the positive impact of having a strong record of on-time payments.\n",
    "* **Differences:** LIME provides more specific information about the thresholds that triggered positive or negative contributions. For example, LIME indicates that a recent inquiry within 7 days would have likely had a negative impact, whereas SHAP simply shows that the time since the most recent inquiry had a positive effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plain-Language Summary for Non-Experts\n",
    "\n",
    "The model predicted that this customer is a \"Good\" credit risk primarily because of their strong credit history. They have a history of making payments on time and have few delinquencies. While they have opened a few new accounts recently, this didn't significantly impact the prediction. Overall, their positive credit history and responsible financial behavior led the model to conclude that they are a low-risk customer.\n"
